# Conceptual Case Study: Hypothetical TFT for Demand Forecasting
*Disclaimer: Fictional scenario based on public ML practices, not tied to any real project or proprietary data.*

### Problem:
A fictional e-commerce platform needs to forecast weekly product demand to streamline inventory.

### My Approach:
Built a theoretical TFT model (using PyTorch Forecasting) to capture complex patterns in mock demand data.
Incorporated static (e.g., product categories) and time-varying features (e.g., promotional events) from public datasets (e.g., Kaggle retail data).
Used attention mechanisms to prioritize key features and rolling cross-validation to ensure robust predictions.

### Challenges:

Handling irregular data gaps. Addressed with TFTâ€™s built-in imputation and attention weighting.

### Outcome:

Hypothetical forecasts improved inventory planning, showcasing advanced time series modeling.
### Visual:

### Key Skills:

Python (pytorch_forecasting), TFT modeling, feature engineering, cross-validation.
